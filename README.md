# semantix
Semantix is a Python package that empowers developers to infuse meaning into their code through enhanced variable typing. By leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs) behind the scenes, Semantix transforms ordinary functions into intelligent, context-aware operations without explicit LLM calls.
