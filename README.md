# Semantix

Semantix is a Python package that empowers developers to infuse meaning into their code through enhanced variable typing. By leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs) behind the scenes, Semantix transforms ordinary functions into intelligent, context-aware operations without explicit LLM calls.

## Key Features:

- **Semantic Type System**: Define rich, meaningful types that carry contextual information.
- **Function Enhancement**: Automatically augment functions with LLM-powered capabilities.
- **Implicit Intelligence**: Leverage advanced NLP and reasoning without direct API calls.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Seamlessly integrate into existing Python codebases with minimal overhead.

Semantix bridges the gap between traditional programming and AI-assisted development, allowing you to write more expressive, powerful code with ease.
