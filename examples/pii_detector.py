Users reported slow response times and timeouts when accessing the sales application. The server load has been consistently above 80% for the past hour.\n\n**Steps Taken:**\n\n1. Verified the server load using the `uptime` command.\n2. Checked running processes and identified several resource-intensive queries on the sales database.\n3. Examined the disk space and found that it is currently at 85% capacity.\n\n**Troubleshooting:**\n\n1. Stopped unnecessary services on the server to free up resources.\n2. Optimized the identified resource-intensive queries.\n3. Cleared the database logs to free up disk space.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n\nThe server load has decreased to around 60%, but still higher than the normal level. The disk space is still at 85% capacity.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. Investigate the possibility of upgrading the server hardware (specifically, adding more RAM and increasing the disk space).\n2. Review the current resource allocation and usage patterns on the server.\n3. Consider implementing a load balancer to distribute the load across multiple servers.\n\n**Resolution Details:**\n\nTo be updated.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\nThe sales application is critical for the business operations, and any further degradation in performance may impact the sales revenue. Immediate action is required to resolve the issue and prevent any recurrence.",
